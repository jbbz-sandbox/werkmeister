"sandbox-core": patch
---

`sandbox init-workspace` no longer adds the current template's stage dirs beside an older ICM layout. In a workspace whose `stages/` holds dirs the current template does not render (e.g. `03_verify`/`04_ship` from before the rename to `03_exercise`/`04_propose`), init now warns and leaves `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `_shared/` and `stages/` as they are, and `skills check`/`sync` leave them alone too. Services are still reconciled into `docker-compose.yml`, `.env` and `.sandbox/sandbox-context.md`. To regenerate the pipeline from the current template, move `stages/` aside and rerun (#149).
