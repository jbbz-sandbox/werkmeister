One workspace-create pipeline: every entry point (`sandbox workspace`, `--browser-form`, the MCP `workspace` / `create-workspace` tools, the /workspaces pane) goes through `createWorkspace`, which fetches the issue (failing the create when it can't be read), stores it in `.sandbox/issue.md`, and renders the same `## Issue` section in ICM and JIT. New `sandbox init-workspace --refresh-issue` and `sandbox workspace --no-distill`; `sandbox connect` checks issue-tracker sign-in; a placeholder Jira `base_url` counts as unset.
