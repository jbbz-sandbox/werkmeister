SW-108: a post-mortem comes before close-out. `close-out` (CLI, MCP, pane, VS Code) refuses while the workspace has no `postmortem.md`, unless `--skip-postmortem "<reason>"` (MCP `skip_postmortem`) gives a reason, which goes in `closeout.md`. The new werkmeister `postmortem` skill gathers the run's problems, agrees a change for each with the person, writes `postmortem.md` and turns each change into an SW issue, standards edit or memory entry. The ICM route table, propose and spike checks, `pr-rules.md` (ICM and JIT) and `sb-pr` send agents there before close-out, and the handoff commits `postmortem.md` to the record branch.
