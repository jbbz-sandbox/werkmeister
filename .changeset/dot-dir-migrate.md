SW-92: `werkmeister migrate` moves `~/.sandbox` to `~/.werkmeister` and repoints every file that carries the old path: `config.yaml` values, `env.sh`, the `~/.zshenv` block, `services.yaml`, the pr-watch launchd agent (or crontab line) and each workspace's compose file. It refuses while a container that mounts the old home, or any workspace container, is running. A second run changes nothing. `--workspaces` also renames each workspace's `.sandbox/` to `.werkmeister/`, and `--check` reports without writing. Registry sync, `detect` and the pre-PR gate now read `<repo>/.werkmeister/services.yaml` first and fall back to `<repo>/.sandbox/services.yaml`. `detect` writes new fragments under `.werkmeister/`. Fragments can use `{{werkmeister_home}}` for the tool's home folder. This repo's fragment moved to `.werkmeister/services.yaml` and uses it, so **pull and rebuild the CLI before the next `registry sync`**: an older build skips the moved fragment. Docs, help text and generated text now say `~/.werkmeister`, with `~/.sandbox` named only as the legacy name.
