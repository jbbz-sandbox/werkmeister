"@jbbz-sandbox/sandbox-cli": minor

`sandbox detect` now generates a repo's `.sandbox/services.yaml` from its package manifests, Dockerfiles, docker-compose files, Helm charts, k8s manifests and kustomize overlays, and re-runs only add what is missing. `--assist` asks Claude about the fields the scan had to guess. The old changed-service report is gone; the `sandbox-detect` MCP tool now returns the proposed fragment and writes it with `write: true`.
