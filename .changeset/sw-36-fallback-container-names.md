The built-in compose fallback now names feature containers `<feature>-<svc>`, as the template does, instead of `sandbox-<feature>-<svc>`. Both paths and the PR gate's container lookup share one `containerOf(feature, svc)`, so a workspace generated through the fallback has containers the gate, restart lines and allow rules can find.
