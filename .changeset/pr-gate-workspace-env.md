"sandbox-core": patch
---

`SANDBOX_FEATURE` is no longer read as the `feature` input. Every workspace container exports it as its own feature name, so a workspace created or inited from inside one was prefilled with that name. Pass `--feature` or set `feature:` in `workspace.yml` instead. The `sandbox-install` setup service now runs `npm ci`, so `sandbox up` no longer rewrites `package-lock.json`, and the compose-logs smoke test targets its own workspace's stack (#148).
