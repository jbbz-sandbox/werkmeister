Workspaces now get `compose.yml`, the Compose v2 preferred name, instead of `docker-compose.yml` (#224). An existing workspace's file is renamed on the next `sandbox init-workspace` or `sandbox up`; until then `down`, `logs` and `close-out` still read `docker-compose.yml`, so a running stack is never orphaned (Compose keys it by project `name:`, which is unchanged).
