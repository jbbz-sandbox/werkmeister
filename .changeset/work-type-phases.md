The workspace's `work_type` now selects its JIT phases. The generated `CLAUDE.md` shows a **Work type** line, a **Gate** line and only that type's By-phase rows (a `refactor` has no research row, a `spike` only research, `bugfix`/`incident` skip review), and the seeded handoff starts at the type's first phase. `sb-research` ends a `feature` in a `decision` note with `status: decided` that records the user's answers and the approved design, and ends a `bugfix`/`incident` in a `finding` naming the root cause. An empty or unknown work type renders as before.
