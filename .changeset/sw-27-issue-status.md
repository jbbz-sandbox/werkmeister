The workspace's issue now moves by itself as the work does (SW-27, SW-24). `sandbox issue start`, run by the first ICM stage and JIT's `sb-research`, moves it to In Progress. `sandbox pr open` moves it to In Review. `sandbox pr status` moves it back to In Progress when a review asks for changes or a PR closes unmerged, and to Done once the work ships; close-out is the safety net. `close-out --abandon` comments the reason, applies `abandoned` when configured, and on GitHub closes the issue as not planned. Configure the statuses with `overrides.issue_statuses: { in_progress, in_review, merged, done, abandoned }` (null skips a point); `issue_review_status` and `issue_done_status` still work. Moves are forward only, post a comment naming the trigger, and a tracker refusal is a warning that never fails a stage, PR open or close-out. On GitHub, a `status:` label replaces the issue's other `status:` labels.
