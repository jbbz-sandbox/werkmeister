"sandbox-core": patch
---

An ICM workspace's tracked `_shared/standards.md` no longer holds machine paths: each row reads `<standards_dir>/<module>/STANDARD.md`, with a line saying `sandbox standards check` prints that root and `sandbox setup` grants Claude Code read access to it. Opening the record on a machine with a different home dir or `overrides.standards_dir` no longer makes `sandbox skills check` report the file as drifted. Existing workspaces get the portable form on their next `sandbox skills sync` (#163).
