"sandbox-core": patch

`discoverRepos` and `repoDirs` now share one rule for which workspace dirs are repos: dot-prefixed dirs are skipped and symlinked dirs count. Before, an icm workspace with a dot-prefixed or symlinked repo dir reported drift in `sandbox skills check` that `sync` could never clear (#110).
