"sandbox-core": patch
---

`sandbox close-out` and `sandbox remove-workspace` now remove the workspace's per-feature Docker volumes (`docker compose down --volumes`) when they delete it, instead of leaving `<feature>-node-modules` and `<feature>-tools` behind. Plain `sandbox down` still keeps them.
