"sandbox-core": patch
---

`init-workspace` no longer treats plain directories (ICM `_shared/`, `stages/`) as repo worktrees when the workspace root is itself a git repo. Before this, it refused with "Refusing to remove worktree(s) with uncommitted changes" or tried to remove them, and it gitignored them. A directory now counts as a repo only if it has its own `.git`. Rerun `sandbox init-workspace` to clean the stale `/_shared/` and `/stages/` lines out of the managed `.gitignore` section.
