Generated workspaces include an issue-filing guide — `_shared/issues-report.md` for icm, `.sandbox/issues-report.md` for jit — routed from `CLAUDE.md`. Every issue has a type (bug | feature | task) that sets its GitHub label (`bug`, `enhancement`, `task`) or Jira issue type (Bug, Story, Task) and its body template. Bugs this workspace's changes caused are fixed in place; bugs that were already there, and features or tasks outside the workspace's task, are filed on `jbbz-sandbox/sandbox` or where the app code's issues live.
